      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;color: #FFFFFF">After the remediation, the Han river became a popular sight in Taichung and people connected it with the famous River Cam in England.  Since then, Han river has got the name of “Taichung Cambridge”.</p>

          <h2>Construction of Cambridge</h2>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to realize the construction deeply, we went to interview Zen-Jay Yung, the Chief of the Third Rivers Bureau of the Water Resources Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Chief mentioned that the percentage of piped sewage was increasing now, but still much of the sewage was not processed before flowing to Han River. To deal with the sewage and purify the water is still the problems we are trying to overcome.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the improvement of water quality reach your goal?</strong><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" the Chief said. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to purify water, the river office is trying its best. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked, "Is there was an idea to create a hydrophilic space in the early stages of construction?"</strong> </p>

          <h2>Water quality</h2>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Chief said that in terms of construction, the Water Resources Department is mainly based on flood control.. Domestic sewage diversion in the United Kingdom reaches 100%, while in Malaysia it reaches 76%, but on average it is only about 26% in Taiwan (25.3% in Taichung).。</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The flow of water itself can clean the river. However, the amount of water still cannot carry away all the waste made by people. Advanced countries in general have to undergo sewage treatment before they can be discharged. However, it is very difficult to achieve a substantial improvement in water quality until the installment rate of sewage diversion could reach 100%. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the Government also plans to lay buried pipes under the roads, but it will inevitably affect public transport and make air pollution during the construction.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the Taichung municipal government has actually done a lot in the water environment.  For example,  the remediation of Huludun. When more fund is engaged in purifying the river in the coming 3 years, the citizens may see a big difference. For example, the rivers will not smell so bad as before.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of the interview, the Chief said macroscopically: "The upgrading of any country always started  from the restoration of rivers. Take Seoul for example, it became an international city after the city renewed Han River.  Kaohsiung City in Taiwan also jumped into a whole new city after  Love River was drained.”</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this interview, we really to hope to let more people know the importance of the treatment of sewage.  It is the core to revive a river as well as a city.</p>
