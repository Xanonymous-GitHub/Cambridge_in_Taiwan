      <p  style="font-size:1.3em;color: #FFFFFF">Current chairwoman of canoe association, Wan-Ru Lin has a lot of contribution to the construction of Cambridge water.  However, her love toward canoeing originated from the puppy love between her daughter and a canoe player.</p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, Wan-Ru's daughter entered Hui-Wen high school and fell in love with a canoe player.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     For Wan-Ru, a student should not fall in love, especially her daughter.  Yet her daughter didn't think that way and considered it as a wrong concept.  Knowing it is impossible to separate them, Wan-Ru tried to see that canoe player.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her daughter finally left the canoe player, Wan-Ru began to fall in love with canoeing because of being acquainted with the beauty of the sports and the hardships that the players encountered.  Wan-Ru found that the players had to practice in a small swimming pool. After the pool was torn down, they were forced to move to a dirty pit. Then she decided to do something for them and the new sports.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally found Cambridge an ideal place for the sports. She tried to contact the Third Rivers Bureau of the Water Resources Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the city councilor and the leaders of local people. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a strange sport still left many people protesting. "Some people even tried to throw stones to drive the canoeing players away." With the guidance of the relevant units, residents and anglers finally came to a mutual understanding. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan-Ru considers that Taiwan is an island surrounded by seas. But, we are a group of people strange to water. She hopes that with the completion of the Cambridge waterfront and the promotion of canoeing, Taiwan can become a real country daring to embrace ocean and the world.</p>
