          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in this competition makes our life more colorful. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the interview, we have to learn how to talk politely.  For writing, we not only need to tidy up the contents we have interviewed but also need to do the researches.  For making web, we not only need to understand the program but also need to ensure every connection and grammars.  For translation, Chinese and English have different logic, so we also need to learn to transform.  Time management and communication are not only a big challenge but also things we must learn.  Experience that learned from stand up after falling down is the most important thing for the future.</p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we need to know is that how to transform the information from interviewer clearly into word. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thanks to all our interviewers. Although we sometimes lost our manners and also made some mistake, they were still  patient answering our questions. I want to thank our director and teacher too. Even though they were busy, they still helped us and let us learn a lot. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in this competition is a new experience for us.  Although we encountered relationship challenge, we still conquered it.  I think it was an unforgettable experience that we should cherish it forever. </p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I didn't expect that I would attend the competition, and I have such good teammates.  No matter what the things are, the opportunity to cooperate together is rare.  I appreciate that I had a chance to get along with different people and know the place again.</p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When I first joined in the project I was confused.  What should I do? What did I learn? In fact, though Cambridge is close to my junior high school, I thought it just a normal river.  However, this project breaks my stereotype.  By teacher's leading, we completed those interviews and recorded the things we discovered.  It was surprising that the association with government and the citizens brought Cambridge to the world.</p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in this competition helps us know about the importance of water environment.  At first, we drained the swage just for our convenience.  It caused the effect that we had to spend more money and time dealing with it.  Although we couldn't see the result immediately, we still believed that we could saw the improvement in the future.  In addition, I learned how important team work is.  Two heads are always better than one.</p>

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a web designer of the competition, I learned a lot of professional skills of constructing webs.  For example, consistency, coordination and every links.  While doing  these jobs, I realized what I can do better, the importance of team work and the time management.  I hope that those experiences could help me do better in the future.</p>

Also, I realize how difficult it is to construct the web pages.  How amazing it was!</p>
