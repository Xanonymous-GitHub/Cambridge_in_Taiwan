                                                    to the present freshness, Cambridge has been reborn as a must go and
                                                    a popular tourist attractions. In the past, the quality of the water
                                                    here was C and D, which was seriously polluted by industrial and
                                                    domestic wastewater. Nowadays, there are many improvements in water

          <p style="color: #FFFFFF;line-height:2.5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the canoe team of
                                                    our school needed a place to practice, thus advocating the
                                                    remediation plan of Cambridge. Now Cambridge has been changed from a
                                                    dirty river into a romantic river side where all citizens could
                                                    enjoy the beautiful scene and relax themselves. However, the huge
                                                    change would not happen without the effort and collaboration of the
                                                    school coaches, community volunteers, city councilmen. It is a
                                                    memorable story worth our noting down.</p>

                                                    team to understand the history behind. Then we visited community

                                                    the river. Last we compile all the data gathered to make a film and
                                                    a website to keep the public aware of the significance of the river.
                                                    Most importantly, we hope inspire the public to treasure the river

                                      many things that we had been quite unfamiliar before, However, we regard all the
                                      challenges as our milestones toward our maturity whether in communication or in

            <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the production of this topic, we learned
                                      how to politely and naturally talk with the interviewers and arrange everything in
                                      an efficient and planned manner. Also, we learned that all the good environment
                                      didn't come from nowhere. Instead, it is a result coming from many heroes' effort
                                      and sacrifice. Our goal is to make more people know their devotion and willing to
                                      do more for our environment after the completion of this website.</p>
