                                    Cambridge environment issue, we seldom paid attention to the surroundings or cared
                                    about the environmental facilities of our hometown. Not until we got indulged in the
                                    subject did we come to understand the local construction of sanitary sewers. How
                                    could Taiwan, an economically prosperous place, bear a so badly-organized sanitary
                                    sewers system? We were also touched by so many people who sacrificed their time and
                                    lives to make our city a better one.</p>

                                     Ms. Lin was originally a parent of a student of our school. She started to care
                                     about canoeing because her daughter fell in love with a canoe player. After she
                                     knew more and more difficulties of the players, she began to help find a better
                                     place for them to practice. Eventually, she now becomes the Director of Canoe
                                     Association in our city and the key person to make the completion of Cambridge come
                                     true. What a romantic story! </p>

                                    Mr. Lin is the chief of Yong Long Village. He held a lot of water activities in
                                    Cambridge for citizens to get close to the river. These acts tremendously boosted
                                    the happiness of local people and the economy of the community. </p>
