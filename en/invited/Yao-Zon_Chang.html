      <h1 class="major h1EN" name="top">Yo-Yu Lin, the assistant of Yao-Zon Chang city councilman</h1>
      <p style="font-size:1.3em;color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the program “ Manufacture
                                                project of the drain of Han river from Chi-Shan bridge to Guo-Guan
                                                bridge, ” the duty of a city councilman is to supervise the schedule
                                                regularly after the program was proposed.

                                                Following is the record of our interview with Lin, the assistant of city
                                                councilor Chang. </p>
      <p style="color: #FFFFFF;font-size:1.3em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remediated Cambridge not only
                                                makes the citizen visit here more often, but also attracts tourists
                                                during weekends. Canoeing team uses here as their training place, but in
                                                the past they might cause some argument with the anglers. Canoeing team
                                                had to share the resources of Cambridge with other anglers since there
                                                was no law and Cambridge was a public place. Some of the anglers hoped
                                                that laws about water activities could be set in Taichung. For the
                                                remediated Cambridge in the future, our purpose is still to purify the
                                                water quality. </p>

          <h2>Difficulties in Practice </h2>
          <span class="image right"><img align="right" alt="" class="image" data-position="right"
                                         src="../../image/20170821_101420.jpg" style="float:right;" width="100%">Image source: photographed by ourselves</span>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of promoting the project, the
                                    most commonly encountered difficulty was probably that the public authorities always
                                    said to us that they did not have enough money. However, if there is really no
                                    funding at this stage, then it is also a good idea to make a wholesome plan first.
                                    After the plan is passed, we may go at raising funds.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another obstacle encountered is the local voice.
                                    Just as in a class, each person will have different opinions. In the process of
                                    remediation, the executive department collects the opinions of many people and often
                                    do not know whom they should listen to. There are users' opinions, local people's
                                    voices and also opinions of representatives of public posts. When many different
                                    opinions are gathered together, it is easy to have a dispute and no one can say
                                    whose opinion is the best. At this moment, the role of city councilor Chang is to
                                    coordinate the work so that the obstacles will be minimized and the project can
                                    proceed smoothly.</p>

          <h2>Difference after Mediation</h2>
          <span class="image right"><img align="right" alt="" class="image" data-position="right"
                                         src="../../image/20170821_105240.jpg" style="float:right;" width="100%">Image source: photographed by ourselves</span>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the remediation, because of the clean
                                    water and green environment, many people will take a walk after dinner. There will
                                    be visitors having a picnic here. We can also see the anglers fishing here. Most
                                    attractive are the street artists performing on both banks.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city councilor is so happy to see all the
                                    positive effects happening because of his efforts. Actually, to bring some benefits
                                    by renewing the environment is more important than an election.</p>
