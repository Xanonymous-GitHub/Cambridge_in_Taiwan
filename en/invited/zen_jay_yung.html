      <p style="font-size: 1.3em;color: #FFFFFF">After the remediation, the Han river became a popular sight in Taichung
                                                 and people connected it with the famous River Cam in England. Since
                                                 then, Han river has got the name of “Taichung Cambridge”.</p>

          <h2>Construction of Cambridge</h2>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to realize the construction deeply, we
                                    went to interview Zen-Jay Yung, the Chief of the Third Rivers Bureau of the Water
                                    Resources Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief mentioned that the percentage of
                                    piped sewage was increasing now, but still much of the sewage was not processed
                                    before flowing to Han River. To deal with the sewage and purify the water is still
                                    the problems we are trying to overcome.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the improvement of water quality
                                            reach your goal?</strong><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" the Chief said. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to purify water, the river office is trying its best. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked, "Is there was an idea to
                                            create a hydrophilic space in the early stages of construction?"</strong>

          <h2>Water quality</h2>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief said that in terms of construction,
                                    the Water Resources Department is mainly based on flood control.. Domestic sewage
                                    diversion in the United Kingdom reaches 100%, while in Malaysia it reaches 76%, but
                                    on average it is only about 26% in Taiwan (25.3% in Taichung).。</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flow of water itself can clean the river.
                                    However, the amount of water still cannot carry away all the waste made by people.
                                    Advanced countries in general have to undergo sewage treatment before they can be
                                    discharged. However, it is very difficult to achieve a substantial improvement in
                                    water quality until the installment rate of sewage diversion could reach 100%. </p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the Government also plans to lay
                                    buried pipes under the roads, but it will inevitably affect public transport and
                                    make air pollution during the construction.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the Taichung municipal government has
                                    actually done a lot in the water environment. For example, the remediation of
                                    Huludun. When more fund is engaged in purifying the river in the coming 3 years, the
                                    citizens may see a big difference. For example, the rivers will not smell so bad as
                                    before.</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of the interview, the Chief said
                                    macroscopically: "The upgrading of any country always started from the restoration
                                    of rivers. Take Seoul for example, it became an international city after the city
                                    renewed Han River. Kaohsiung City in Taiwan also jumped into a whole new city after
                                    Love River was drained.”</p>
          <p style="color: #FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this interview, we really to hope to let
                                    more people know the importance of the treatment of sewage. It is the core to revive
                                    a river as well as a city.</p>
